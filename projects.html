        <p>Hello everyone!!!!!.
            I am very excited to share to you all that I have completed my first project on data analysis provided by CODEBASICS.
            In this project I have analyzed the data that had provided to me(CODEX is a german beverage company) which consists of 9 columns and 10,000 rows,which is a beverage company that needs help for data analyst .I have done this project using 4 types of software which are listed below:
            1.Excel- Cleaning and structure the data in a right manner.
            2.SQL -To provide insights from the data
            3.Powerbi -For visualize the data that needs to be understand for all.
            4.Canva-For formatting video of the presentation
            
            Excel-I have remove duplicates(but there were no duplicates) and formatted the unstructured data.
            SQL-I have derived insights based on insights they have provided and also additional insights that I have derived.I have various commands such as select,group by,where,order by etc,..
            Powerbi-used for visual representation of data.
            I have used BOOKMARKS and various options that are avaliable in powerbi.
            Canva-Format the video for presentation.
            
            So,thus i have enjoyed and learned a lot by done this project and I am very happy to share this to all of you.</p>
